    <h1>DevOps - Definition</h1>
    <p>DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). The goal of DevOps is to shorten the software development lifecycle, increase the frequency of deployments, and improve the reliability of systems.</p>
    <p>The main ideas of DevOps are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Collaboration: Dev and Ops teams work together as one team.</li>
        <li>Automation: Automate as many tasks as possible related to software development and deployment.</li>
        <li>Continuous improvement: Continuously monitor and optimize processes.</li>
        <li>Learning culture: Create a culture where mistakes are seen as opportunities to learn.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Benefits of DevOps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Faster software deployment</li>
        <li>Higher software quality</li>
        <li>Increased system reliability</li>
        <li>Improved communication and collaboration between teams</li>
        <li>Reduced costs</li>
    </ul>
